abstract = "We generalize and improve earlier constructions of low-discrepancy sequences by Sobol', Faure, and the author, thus obtaining sequences in the s-dimensional unit cube with the smallest discrepancy that is currently known. The construction is based on the theory of (t, s)-sequences. It is also shown that the dispersion of the sequences constructed here has the smallest possible order of magnitude among any sequences in the s-dimensional unit cube."
